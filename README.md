# Is_there_a_Set
This Android application helps people to play a card game called “Set”. If users are struggling at finding a Set, they can just type their cards into the app, and it would automatically calculate whether there is a Set.

Uses:
1) XML to display information & interact with users
2) Java for business logic (to determine whether there is a Set and notify the user)
3) MVC pattern
